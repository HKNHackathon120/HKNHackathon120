# Dear Teams, welcome to the IEEE-HKN International Hackathon repository!

Today, **October 11th**, marks the official start of our international IEEE-HKN Hackathon.

Here, you can view the challenges your team will tackle.

You have **10 days**, until 2:00 PM (EST) on October 22nd, to complete and submit all tasks asynchronously. Submissions should be made by the team representative using the form linked in the README file of each task. Please include your team name to help the jury identify your submissions.

The hackathon is centered around fictional anecdotes inspired by some of our **HKN founders**. While these stories are imaginative, they are based on historical facts from our archives. HKN values scholarship, character, and integrity, and weâ€™ve created this storyline to highlight the strong moral character of our founders. Your mission is to help them overcome their adversaries!

Each task is tied to a specific storyline, one for each founder, so we recommend reading the story first before diving into the task details. Your goal is to solve as many tasks as you can within the 10-day timeframe, focusing on the evaluation criteria for each task.
You can resubmit your task using the form if you make last-minute edits. **The jury will consider your last submission for evaluation!**

On **October 28th at 12:00 PM (EST)**, all teams will present a short, **4-minute presentation** (slides are allowed) showcasing their best work. This final challenge will earn you extra points, and afterward, the winning teams will be announced along with the prizes!

For support, please post your questions in the relevant task-specific channels on the Discord server, which are named after the tasks. (If you haven't joined yet, here is the invite link. Introduce yourself in the welcome thread to be granted access and the participant role: [https://discord.gg/6zbVBSef](https://discord.gg/6zbVBSef)). You can also use the private voice and chat channels provided for your team to collaborate.

# Good luck, have fun, and we look forward to seeing your innovative solutions! ðŸ’¡
